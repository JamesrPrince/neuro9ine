As web development continues to evolve, staying current with best practices is crucial for building successful applications. Here's our guide to modern web development in 2025.

## Architecture and Framework Selection

The landscape of web frameworks has matured significantly. Key considerations for modern applications include:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) vs. Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Edge computing capabilities
- Hydration strategies
- Type safety across the stack
- Build performance and bundle size

## Performance Optimization

Performance remains critical for user experience and SEO:

1. Core Web Vitals optimization
2. Image optimization and lazy loading
3. Code splitting and dynamic imports
4. Caching strategies
5. Service Worker implementation

## Developer Experience

Modern tooling has revolutionized how we write and maintain code:

- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Vitest for unit testing
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Security Best Practices

Security considerations for modern web apps:

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTPS everywhere
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular dependency updates
- Security headers optimization

Remember, the best tech stack is one that balances performance, developer experience, and maintainability while meeting your specific project requirements.
